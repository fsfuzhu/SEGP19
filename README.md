# SEGP19 Project

## Project Overview

The SEGP19 project aims to assist pathologists by reducing the time and stress associated with analyzing Pap smear images. By leveraging artificial intelligence, this project enhances efficiency in the diagnostic process.

## Directory Structure

- `model_result/08112024_yolo_model_performance_img/`: Contains images and files related to the performance evaluation of the YOLO model.
- `model_src/`: Source code for the model.
- `tools/`: Auxiliary tools, including those for pathologist verification and SVS file conversion.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Model Performance Evaluation**: Review the performance evaluation results of the model, such as F1 curves, PR curves, and confusion matrices, located in the `model_result/08112024_yolo_model_performance_img/` directory.
2. **Pathologist Verification Tool**: Utilize the `quick_ui.py` script or the `quick_ui.exe` executable found in the `tools/pathologist_verification/` directory for pathologist verification.
3. **SVS File Conversion Tool**: Use the `convertSVS.py` script in the `tools/split_svs_to_jpg/` directory to convert SVS files to JPG format.
