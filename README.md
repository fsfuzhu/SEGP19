# SEGP19 Project

## Project Overview

The SEGP19 project focuses on developing and evaluating the performance of the YOLO model, along with providing tools for pathologist verification.

## Directory Structure

- `model_result/08112024_yolo_model_performance_img/`: Contains images and files related to the performance evaluation of the YOLO model.
- `model_src/`: Source code for the model.
- `tools/`: Auxiliary tools, including those for pathologist verification and SVS file conversion.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Model Performance Evaluation**: Review the performance evaluation results of the model, such as F1 curves, PR curves, and confusion matrices, located in the `model_result/08112024_yolo_model_performance_img/` directory.
2. **Pathologist Verification Tool**: Utilize the `quick_ui.py` script or the `quick_ui.exe` executable found in the `tools/pathologist_verification/` directory for pathologist verification.
3. **SVS File Conversion Tool**: Use the `convertSVS.py` script in the `tools/split_svs_to_jpg/` directory to convert SVS files to JPG format.
